In this programme, we have 3 questions of multiple-choice answer where if we choose the correct option then it will move to the next question and also give a random score for that question between 1-10 but if the answer will be wrong then it will repeat the question. We can also skip the question if we type “SKIP” in answer after that it will confirm that are you sure you want to Skip or not for that enter “y” for yes or “n” for no. In the end, it will also provide your final score which will be similar to the maximum score obtained in the random scores.
